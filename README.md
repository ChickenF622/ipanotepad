# IPA Notepad

##Building

To build simply run build.bat and then run install.bat to install the apk to your connected Android device.

##Features

+ The main feature of the app is being able to type out diction using the keyboard on the screen. This works like a normal keyboard and it should be possible to just start typing immeadiately.
+ In the lower left hand corner there is a button that has a speech bubble. Clicking on that button will bring up a dialog for comments. To edit simple click on the text field and the phone's default keyboard will be displayed. To save the change tap 'Ok', or to exit without saving tap 'Cancel'.
+ The save icon should bring up a dialog box to save the diction. Click on the text field to then type in the name the diction should be saved as. Then tap 'Save' to save the app or 'Cancel' to abort saving the diciton. This also formats the diciton, if it isn't properly formatted, to conform to the current slashing rule.
+ Right next to that there should be an 'Open File' icon. Clicking on that will bring up a list of all the saved dictions and selecting one will load both the saved diction along with the comments.
+ In the options menu there will be 3 options:
  + Save As... Forces the save dialog to always appear
  + Share will share the text of the diction through any app that accepts text (eg an email app or text messaging app)
  + Settings will bring up the apps settings which is currently has only one setting which is slashing. The slashing settings has 3 options:
    + Each Word - Places slashes around each word
    + Entire Phrase - Places slashes at the beginning and end of the diction
    + None - No slashes will be placed
